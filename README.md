# HandballStats-Django-Task

To set-up the docker go to ```iris-django/handballStats``` and execute ```docker build -t handballstats -f Dockerfile .```

After this execute ```docker run -d -p 8000:8000 handballstats```

You should be able to see the website on this link "http://0.0.0.0:8000/"

I uploaded it on heroku but it's not working as supposed to! "https://handballstats.herokuapp.com/"

I would love to get a feedback from you!

Thank you for your time!
